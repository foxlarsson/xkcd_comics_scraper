# xkcd_comics_scraper
A script inspired by the Automate the Boring Stuff with Python book, bringing together some of the concepts learned.

The script currently does the following: 

1. open the main page of the xkcd comics
1. get title, hover text, permalink and embed url for current image + link to previous image
1. download image, print file name, title, hover text, permalink and embed url
1. open previous image page and repeat steps 2 - 4 in the range specified

Currently working on adding functionality for writing image data to an excel table.
